We are using netlify functions to access the keys. You have to install the **netlify CLI** and run `netlify dev` instead of `npm start`.

[How to Securely Access Secret API keys using Netlify Functions in a React App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-access-secret-api-keys-using-netlify-functions-in-a-react-app/)  (kindly shared by Jonathan)

First, create a `.env` file in your project's root directory and store your API keys in it.
```
// .env
OWM_API_KEY="Your-OpenWeatherMap-API-key"
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="Your-Google-Maps-API-key"
```

Second, install netlify CLI.
```
npm install netlify-cli -g
```

Then run the following command.
```
netlify dev
```

Actually, the keys are not entirely hidden. That's because of the library `@react-google-maps/api` we used. You can still see them inside the Developer's Tools. We are just practicing how to use netlify functions for our own knowledge.

We are using OpenWeather's [**Developer's Plan**](https://openweathermap.org/price#current) which allows the App to fetch daily and hourly forecasts. You will not be able to fetch them if your OpenWeather API key is generated by the [**Free**](https://openweathermap.org/price#current) plan.  

You also have to make sure your Google Maps API key is activated for the following: [**Geocoding API**](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/cloud-setup) and [**Maps JavaScript API**.](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/cloud-setup).
